LTCaesar Scripts
================

A selection of scripts that make running
[LTCaesar](https://github.com/jborrow/lagrangian-transfer) a little easier.

A sample submission script is provided.

You will need to copy `parameter_example.yml` to `parameters.yml` and modify
it for your specific run parameters, with particular note on the paths to
the halo catalogue and initial and final conditions.
